# AI Coding Rules

This is the code for the https://aicodingrules.org website.


The rapid emergence of AI coding agents has ushered in a new era of software development, promising unprecedented efficiencies in code generation, refactoring, and debugging. However, the current landscape is characterized by a fragmented approach to defining and applying the operational "rules" that govern these agents. Each tool employs its own proprietary mechanisms, syntax, and scoping models, leading to significant challenges in interoperability, consistent quality, and robust security enforcement across diverse development environments.

We need a vendor-agnostic standard designed to unify the definition, scoping, and application of rules for AI coding agent behavior. The proposed specification synthesizes existing best practices observed in leading tools and introduces a resilient framework to support the future evolution of AI-assisted development.
